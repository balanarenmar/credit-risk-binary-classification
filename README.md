# **Credit Risk Binary Classification**

A Case study analyzing the performance of different classification algorithms against loan risk data.

We created a predictive classification model using R to predict if a customer is likely to default their loan or not, helping make informed decisions about which loan applications to approve.

Additionaly, we compared the difference between Hold-out and Cross-Validation method for splitting the testing and training partitions, as well as different split percentages.

+ Handling Missing Data
    - Columns irrelevant to the classifier such as `member_id`,  `zip_code`, `addr_state` etc. were dropped.
    - Columns where the majority of data have missing values *(at about 50%)* were also removed.
